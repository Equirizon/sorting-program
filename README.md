# Sorting Program
### Overview
This is a Python-based sorting program that allows users to input a list of elements and sort them using different sorting algorithms. The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can select from various sorting methods and sorting orders.

### Features
- Supports Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort
- Can handle both integers and letters as input
- Allows sorting in ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A) order
- Provides step-by-step sorting process for better understanding
- Includes an Advanced Mode for debugging and additional insights

## Usage
Running the Program
Open a terminal or command prompt.\
Run the Python script:
`python "Sorting Program.py"`\
Follow the on-screen prompts to select a sorting algorithm and input elements.

## Menu Options
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [1] | Selection Sorting	Sorts the list using the selection sort algorithm |
| [2] | Bubble Sorting	Sorts the list using the bubble sort algorithm |
| [3] | Insertion Sorting	Sorts the list using the insertion sort algorithm |
| [4] | Merge Sorting	Sorts the list using the merge sort algorithm |
| [0] | Toggle Advanced Mode	Enables or disables advanced mode for debugging |

## Input Types
- Users can choose to input integers or letters
- The minimum list size is 2 elements
- Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order

## Requirements
- Python 3.x-
- A command-line interface (Terminal, Command Prompt, or PowerShell)

### Notes
The program clears the screen before execution to maintain a clean interface.
The Advanced Mode provides additional information about the sorting process.
If an invalid input is provided, the program prompts the user to retry.
